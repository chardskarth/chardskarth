### Hey, it's chardskarth! 👋


I'm a coffee fueled, software engineer currenly working at [White Cloak Technologies Inc.](https://www.whitecloak.com/) as an Engineering Manager. 


As of the moment, I'm buried deep under the rabbit hole of [ricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/), all the while trying to keep living a normal life.  
And besides burying myself deeper in this hole I'm in: 
* I share my [music](https://soundcloud.com/chardmusic) here. 
* I have a couple of [friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrh5L2v5OeE&ab_channel=R) who [play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wsI0cSTkc&ab_channel=R). 
* I'm trying to [learn nihongo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/Leechado?via=share_profile). たすけてください.
