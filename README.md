### Hey, it's chardskarth! üëã


I'm a coffee fueled, software engineer currenly working at [White Cloak Technologies Inc.](https://www.whitecloak.com/) as a Capability Lead for Software Engineers.  
I own [blog.chardskarth.me](https://blog.chardskarth.me), see you there!


As of the moment, I'm trying out blogging, all the while trying to keep living a normal life.  
 
* I was once buried deep under the rabbit hole of [ricing](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/).
* I share my [music](https://soundcloud.com/chardmusic) here. 
* I have a couple of [friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrh5L2v5OeE&ab_channel=R) who [play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8wsI0cSTkc&ab_channel=R). 
* I'm trying to [learn nihongo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/Leechado?via=share_profile). „Åü„Åô„Åë„Å¶„Åè„Å†„Åï„ÅÑ.
